<h1 align="center">Notification Project</h1>

<h2>Description ðŸ“ƒ</h2>
<p>This code consumes an API called 'Awesome API' that returns the current currency quote from the financial market.<br>
  Here, the conversion from Dollar and Euro to Brazilian Real was used.</p>

<p>A function was also used that sends notification via Gmail using Google's SMTP domain over port 587 (as defined<br>
  by Google's security).</p>

<p>The project can be integrated to a server so that it can run all the time, here a server wasn't used, only an algorithm<br>
  was built to consume the API, but it's up to you to use integration with servers.</p>
